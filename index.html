		<h2>Get to know a little about myself</h2>
	
		<article>
			<p style="text-indent: 7%">I was born in Faribault, MN but raised in Del Rio, TX. In the small town of Del Rio, I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by a close-knit family and friends, as well as a rich, Mexican heritage. To me, this meant growing up to appreciate my culture and the importance of trust, hard work, and the respect that comes with relationships. Today, I channel these into different mediums in my life, from my art and music, to my web and mobile development projects. </p>

			<h3>
				Texas Tech University
			</h3>
			<h4>
				B.S. in Computer Engineering, graduated in Dec. 2016
			</h4>
			<p>
				A lot of my experiences from Texas Tech University played a major role into shaping the person who I am today. My course load consisted of projects and exercises that expanded my knowledge on programming and circuit design, as well as working on teams that taught me how to switch between team-player and leadership roles. The skills that I’ve come to cultivate that cannot be taught include adapting to an unfamiliar issue with a project and being able to articulate my ideas while maintaining an air of professionalism. I also consider myself very fortunate to have had peers and professors who not only challenged me, but taught me valuable life lessons that I consider to be just as important, but rarer, as some of the course material.

			<h3>
				Del Rio High School
			</h3>
			<h4>
				Graduated in 2011
			</h4>
			<p>
				Much of my time spent in high school was spent focusing on myself, whether it was my grades, my hobbies, or my finding where my strengths lie. Most of my peers would attest to my creative nature, like sketching, writing song lyrics, and playing the guitar in the school band, and even playing in multiple award-winning mariachi contests. When I wasn’t channeling my energy into abstract subjects, I was focusing on topics that I was always passionate about, such as Algebra, Physics, Digital Electronics, and Chemistry. Perhaps the biggest, core concept that I discovered about myself is my love for learning new things in and outside of a classroom.
